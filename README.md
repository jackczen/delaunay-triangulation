# Java Delaunay Triangulation Library

### Overview

This program provides an *O(n log n)* algorithm for constructing two-dimensional [Delaunay diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation). It achieves this by utilizing the [Quad-edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad-edge) data structure, first introduced by Leonidas Guibas and Jorge Stolfi in their landmark paper ["Primitives for the Manipulation of General Subdivisions and the Computation of Voronoi Diagrams"
